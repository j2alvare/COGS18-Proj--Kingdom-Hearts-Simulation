# COGS18-Proj--Kingdom-Hearts-Simulation

This project is a video game simulation inspired by the Kingdom Hearts franchise. The user must input their username password, etc. before being granted access to the game. The user will then interact in conversation with Mickey and discuss about the user's origins, name, and weapon. Ultimately, the user will have to challenge a monster using the weapon selected. Once the monster is defeated the player will complete Level 1.

The game uses classes, functions, and a chatbot. In order to progress into the game, the user must select the right choices. The user will unlock graphics as they progress through the game, with the final graphic being the image of the monster that they will fight.

I borrowed code from the chatbots assignment but I added in my own inputs and outputs for the chatbot to respond to.
